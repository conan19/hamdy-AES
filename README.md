# hamdy-AES
simple AES encryption/decryption python code

that is simple AES-128 encryption/decryption algorithm created by Hamdy Ayman
that uses standard functions (subByte,shiftRows,mixColumns,addRoundKey) and ordinary key expansion function

Note:the padding character used in encryption '0x0b' 

first of all program ask for 128 encryption/decryption key for example 'hamdyaymanhamdyi' 
make sure that the key is only 128 bit == 16 byte as example
then press 1 for encryption & 2 for decryption
if you want to encrypt you'll asked to enter the plain text, for example 'hamdy ayman hamdy ismaeel' 
and if you want to decrypt you'll asked to enter cipher text but hex encoded as '0x880x120x550x1c'

Note: don't forget to enter key & text between quotations
